Amazing Style for VS code

## Prerequisite

### Fira Code

## Philosophy

### White, the Holy

The white commemorates the efforts from prior works, include language syntax, libraries, defined types and data structures.
Change white tokens with highest level of respect.
It is very likely that one would break some code after modifying them.
Think them as holy code for your religion.

### Red, the Devoted

Red barely shows its firing as it's an absolute dedication.
When it does come up, pay your dearest attention.

### Blue, the Humble

Blue is the deepest one.
They demand the least attention, just the like the water, which flows to the lowest ground.
However, they direct lost ones the best way of rationales, though they never fighting for their compliance.
They let you see and believe.

### Green, the Creative

Most of the time, one needs the power of growth, creative thinking, and inspiration.
All those perks belong to the Green.
Feel free to change those as they are drafted.
Just like the new bamboo sprout in the Spring.
They don't mind it neither, cause there will be plenty to come.

### Yellow, the Luxurious

A true beauty shines with their jewelry.
They are often envied, hated, and despised for their unnecessary complexity.
But, what's a life, without the finest artistic decor?
You know, most the time, you need their money.

### Black, the Daring

Coding is like walking down a deep forest, filled up with unknowns.
The love and the fun come from opening an IDE and code it away.
It's like telling the universe a story in your dream.

The night is long and full of terrors.
But we dare.

### Purple, the Shifting

Purple indicates actions, transformations, and calling for changes.

Purple is the composite of the Blue and the Red.
One acts, the other reacts.
Changing is the only everlasting.
Prepare your rain coat, before,not after, it rains.
